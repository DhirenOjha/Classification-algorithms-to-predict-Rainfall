### Classification-algorithms-to-predict-Rainfall
Classification algorithms is used to create a model based on training data and evaluation of model is done on testing data using evaluation metrics.

Algorithms Used-
1. Linear Regression(not suitable for classification, used just to compare different algorithms)
2. K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
3. Decision Tree
4. Logistic Regression
5. Support Vector Machine(SVM)

Evaluation Metrics Used-
1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Score
3. F1-Score
4. Log-Loss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score

Dataset- 
 
Source of dataset is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and data can be gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/
